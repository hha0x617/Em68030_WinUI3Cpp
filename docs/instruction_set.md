## Implementation Strategy (C++ WinUI3)

### Opcode Dispatch

65536-entry function pointer table (`OpcodeHandler[65536]`). Each entry is a member function
pointer to InstructionDecoder. Initialized in `InitOpcodeTable()`, with hot opcodes overridden
by specialized fast handlers registered directly into the table.

### Fast Handlers

High-frequency opcodes bypass the group decoder and are dispatched directly:

| Handler | Opcodes | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| FastMOVEQ | 0x7000-0x7EFE (bit8=0) | Move quick immediate. Bit8=1 opcodes are not registered and fall through to DecodeGroup7 (illegal) |
| FastMOVE_L_Dn_Dm | MOVE.L Dn,Dm | Register-to-register long move |
| FastBcc_B | 0x6x01-0x6xFE (cond!=0) | Conditional branch with 8-bit displacement |
| FastRTS | 0x4E75 | Return from subroutine |
| FastADD_L | ADD.L Dn,Dm | Register-to-register long add |
| FastSUB_L | SUB.L Dn,Dm | Register-to-register long sub |
| FastCMP_L | CMP.L Dn,Dm | Register-to-register long compare |

BRA.B (0x6001-0x60FE) has no dedicated fast handler; handled by DecodeGroup6.

### Deferred Register Snapshot

`_cpu.EnsureRegSnapshot()` is called at the top of every group decoder and FastRTS.
Register snapshots for bus error recovery are deferred until just before instruction
execution, eliminating snapshot cost during JIT block execution when no snapshot is needed.

### JIT Compiler

Pre-decoded `JitOp` struct array + switch dispatch. Each JitOp stores the decoded opcode type,
source/destination, and immediate value. A dead flag elimination pass runs at compile time,
skipping flag calculations that are overwritten by subsequent instructions.

- Files: `Core/JitCompiler.h`, `Core/JitCompiler.cpp`
- ExecuteNextFast() and ExecuteNextFastJit() are completely separate functions.
  Merging them caused function body bloat that dropped JIT OFF speed from 48 to 36 MHz.
- Execution function is selected via member function pointer at emulation loop start,
  eliminating per-instruction branching.
- Block lookup is inlined in ExecuteNextFastJit(). Only on a hit is the noinline
  ExecuteNextJit(block) called.

### Performance

~44.14 MIPS / ~269.85 MHz-cycles (JIT OFF, measured via Avg mode), ~6.1 cycles/instruction
~41.90 MIPS / ~256.17 MHz-cycles (JIT ON, -5.1% overhead)

> **Note**: These figures are approximate estimates, not cycle-accurate measurements.
> - **MHz** = total emulated cycles / wall-clock seconds / 1,000,000. Cycle counts come from
>   a 65,536-entry static lookup table (`s_cycleTable`) with EA cost adjustments, which
>   approximates MC68030 timing but does not model pipeline, cache, or bus wait states.
> - **MIPS** = total emulated instructions / wall-clock seconds / 1,000,000.
> - **Avg** values are cumulative from the start of a Run session. Instantaneous values
>   are sampled every ~500ms.
> - Results vary depending on workload, host CPU, and system load.

> **Linux shows significantly lower MHz/MIPS than NetBSD**: When running a Linux kernel,
> the displayed MHz and MIPS values may be dramatically lower than during a NetBSD session.
> The effect is most pronounced at an idle shell prompt (e.g., ~1.5 MHz / ~0.2 MIPS),
> but is also visible during boot. This is primarily caused by two factors:
>
> 1. **STOP instruction idle time** — Linux uses the M68K `STOP` instruction (0x4E72) to
>    halt the CPU while waiting for interrupts (interrupt-driven idle). During a STOP,
>    the emulator executes no instructions and accumulates no cycles, but wall-clock time
>    continues to elapse. Since MHz and MIPS are computed as cycles (or instructions)
>    divided by wall-clock time, extended STOP periods cause both metrics to drop
>    significantly. At an idle shell prompt, nearly all time is spent in STOP, so the
>    values become extremely low. NetBSD, by contrast, tends to use busy-wait loops that
>    continuously execute instructions, keeping the counters high even when idle.
>
> 2. **Incomplete SCSI interrupt handling** — The WD33C93 SCSI controller emulation does
>    not yet fully support all interrupt scenarios expected by the Linux kernel driver.
>    During SCSI disk probing, unhandled interrupt conditions can cause the driver to
>    enter polling loops or wait for events that never arrive, further reducing the
>    effective instruction throughput. This is a known limitation that will be addressed
>    by improving WD33C93 interrupt emulation.
>
> The low values do not indicate a bug in the MHz/MIPS measurement itself — they
> accurately reflect that the emulated CPU is spending much of its time idle or stalled.

### Cycle Table

`s_cycleTable[65536]` (uint8_t): Static lookup table. EA cost functions compute
memory access overhead per addressing mode.

## JIT Summary

JIT compiles basic blocks of instructions. Register-only blocks execute entirely in JIT.
Memory access blocks use a **data page cache bailout** mechanism: on cache hit, execution
continues in JIT; on cache miss, the block bails out to the interpreter at the current
instruction. Blocks that bail out too frequently (>64 times) are blacklisted and evicted.

~60 instruction patterns are supported:

| Category | Instructions |
|----------|-------------|
| Move (register) | MOVEQ, MOVE.L Dn->Dm, MOVE.L An->Dn, MOVEA.L Dn->An, MOVEA.L An->Am |
| Move (memory) | MOVE.L (An)->Dm, (An)+->Dm, Dm->(An), d16(An)->Dm, Dm->d16(An) (bailout) |
| Arithmetic | ADD/SUB/CMP .B/.W/.L (Dn,Dm), ADDQ/SUBQ .B/.W/.L (Dn, An), NEG .B/.W/.L Dn |
| Multiply | MULU.W, MULS.W (Dn,Dm) |
| Logic | AND/OR/EOR .B/.W/.L (Dn,Dm), NOT/CLR/TST .B/.W/.L Dn |
| Shift | ASL/ASR/LSL/LSR.L #imm,Dn |
| Bit | BTST Dn,Dm |
| Register | EXG (all 3 forms), SWAP Dn, EXT.W/EXT.L/EXTB.L Dn |
| Address | LEA (An)/d16(An)/d8(An,Xn),Ar |
| Branch | BRA .B/.W, Bcc .B/.W (all conditions) |
| Subroutine | RTS (bailout) |
| Other | NOP |

### C++ JIT Implementation Details

- Pre-decoded `JitOp` struct array + switch dispatch
- Dead flag elimination pass skips flag calculations overwritten by subsequent instructions
- Deferred register snapshot: eager memcpy only on JIT block hit
- Sampling at TickInterval (256), threshold = 16 hits to compile

#### Tuning Parameters

The following parameters are configurable via Settings → Performance → JIT:

- **Compile Threshold** (default: 16): The number of times a basic block must be sampled
  at the hot-block detection point before it is compiled. The emulator samples the current PC
  every TickInterval (256) instructions; when the same block address accumulates this many hits,
  compilation is triggered. A lower value compiles more aggressively (more blocks compiled sooner,
  but more compilation overhead). A higher value is more conservative (only the hottest loops
  are compiled). Since JIT currently has net negative performance impact (~5% slower), adjusting
  this value has limited practical effect.

- **Min Block Length** (default: 3): The minimum number of JIT-compilable instructions a basic
  block must contain to be worth caching. Blocks shorter than this threshold are immediately
  marked as uncompilable and will never be compiled, even if they are frequently executed.
  This avoids the overhead of compiling and dispatching very short blocks where the per-block
  setup cost (snapshot, lookup, call) would outweigh the benefit. Increasing this value reduces
  the number of compiled blocks; decreasing it allows more blocks to be compiled but may increase
  dispatch overhead for trivial blocks.
- ExecuteNextFast() (interpreter) and ExecuteNextFastJit() are completely separate functions
  (merging them caused function body bloat that dropped JIT OFF from 48 to 36 MHz)
- Block lookup is inlined in ExecuteNextFastJit(); only on a hit is the noinline
  ExecuteNextJit(block) called
- Bailout mechanism: `JitExecResult { nextPC, executedCount, executedCycles }` return struct
  enables partial block execution. Memory access instructions check data page cache; on miss,
  execution returns to interpreter. Blocks exceeding 64 bailouts are blacklisted.
- Tests: 335 total (including JIT-specific tests in CpuTests/JitCompilerTests.cpp)

### Performance

| Mode | MHz (cycles) | MIPS | Notes |
|------|-------------|------|-------|
| JIT OFF | ~270 | ~44.1 | Baseline |
| JIT ON | ~256 | ~41.9 | -5.1% overhead due to bailout frequency |
