# Em68030 User Guide

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. Extract the archive to a folder of your choice
2. Run `Em68030.exe`

> **Note**: Windows Defender SmartScreen may block the unsigned executable on first run.
> Click "More info" → "Run anyway", or right-click the exe → Properties → check "Unblock".

### First Boot (NetBSD)

1. Open **Settings** (Settings menu)
2. Set **Board Type** to "MVME147"
3. Add a SCSI disk image: click **+ Add Disk**, browse to your disk image, select SCSI ID
4. (Optional) Set a CD-ROM ISO image for installation
5. Click **OK**
6. **File → Open ELF** (Ctrl+E) to load a NetBSD kernel (`netbsd-GENERIC`)
7. Press **Run** (F5) to start execution

For detailed OS installation guides, see [Getting Started](getting_started.md).

### First Boot (Linux)

1. Open **Settings**, set **Board Type** to "MVME147"
2. Set **Target OS** to "Linux"
3. Set the **Command Line** (e.g., `root=/dev/sda1 console=tty0 console=ttyS0`)
4. Add SCSI disk images and click **OK**
5. **File → Open ELF** (Ctrl+E) to load a Linux kernel (`vmlinux`)
6. Press **Run** (F5)

> **Console priority**: When multiple `console=` parameters are specified, the
> **last one** becomes the primary console (login prompt). For example,
> `console=tty0 console=ttyS0` makes the serial port the primary console.

> **Debugging**: To enable early boot messages before the main console driver
> is initialized, add `earlyprintk` to the command line:
> `root=/dev/sda1 console=ttyS0 earlyprintk`

> **Known issue — Framebuffer**: Do not enable the framebuffer in Settings
> unless the guest kernel has the framebuffer driver module installed.
> Enabling it without the driver causes the kernel to switch to the
> framebuffer console (`tty0`), which cannot display output, resulting in
> no login prompt on any console.

## Breakpoints & Watchpoints Window

Manages breakpoints and memory watchpoints for debugging. Open via **View → Breakpoints Window**.

### Breakpoints

A breakpoint pauses execution when the CPU reaches a specific address.

- **Setting a breakpoint**: Double-click an address in the disassembly view
- **Enable/Disable**: Toggle the checkbox next to each breakpoint
- **Delete**: Click the **Del** button on a specific breakpoint
- **Clear All**: Click the **Clear All** button to remove all breakpoints and watchpoints
- **Run to breakpoint**: Press F5; execution stops when a breakpoint address is reached
- **Jump to address**: Double-click a breakpoint in the list to navigate the disassembly view

### Conditional Breakpoints

A breakpoint can have an optional condition expression. Execution only pauses when
the condition evaluates to true.

To set or edit a condition:

1. Open the **Breakpoints Window** (View → Breakpoints Window)
2. Click the **Cond** button next to the target breakpoint
3. Enter a condition expression in the dialog (e.g., `D0==0x1234`)
4. Click **OK** to apply, or **Clear** to remove the condition

Breakpoints with conditions display the expression below the address as `if D0==0x1234`.

Conditions support:

| Element | Examples | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Data registers | `D0`, `D7` | 32-bit value of the data register |
| Address registers | `A0`, `A7`, `SP` | 32-bit value of the address register (`SP` = `A7`) |
| Special registers | `PC`, `SR` | Program counter or status register |
| Comparison | `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` | Unsigned 32-bit comparison |
| Bitwise AND | `SR&0x2000!=0` | Test specific bits: `(SR & 0x2000) != 0` |
| Memory read | `[0x1000].b`, `[A0].w`, `[$2000].l` | Read byte/word/long from address |
| Address arithmetic | `[A7+12].l`, `[A0+0xC].w`, `[A7-4].b` | `+` or `-` offset inside `[...]` |
| IN set | `D0 IN {1, 3, 7, 20}` | True if value matches any element in `{...}` |
| Logical OR | `expr1 \|\| expr2` | True if either expression is true |
| Logical AND | `expr1 && expr2` | True if both expressions are true |
| Grouping | `(expr1 \|\| expr2) && expr3` | `()` overrides default precedence |
| Number formats | `255`, `0xFF`, `$FF` | Decimal, C-style hex, or Motorola-style hex |

`&&` has higher precedence than `||`: `A || B && C` is evaluated as `A || (B && C)`.
Use `()` to override: `(A || B) && C`.

**Condition examples:**

| Condition | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `D0==0x1234` | Break when D0 equals 0x1234 |
| `A7<0x10000` | Break when stack pointer is below 64KB |
| `SR&0x2000!=0` | Break when in supervisor mode |
| `[0x1000].w==0xBEEF` | Break when word at address $1000 equals $BEEF |
| `[A7+12].l==0` | Break when longword at (A7+12) equals 0 (stack-relative) |
| `[A0+D1].w!=0` | Break when word at (A0+D1) is non-zero |
| `D0 IN {1, 3, 7, 20}` | Break when D0 is 1, 3, 7, or 20 |
| `[A7+12].l IN {1, 3}` | Break when longword at (A7+12) is 1 or 3 |
| `D0==1 \|\| D0==3` | Break when D0 is 1 or 3 |
| `D0>0 && D0<100` | Break when D0 is between 1 and 99 |
| `(D0==1 \|\| D0==3) && SR&0x2000!=0` | D0 is 1 or 3, AND in supervisor mode |
| `D0==D1` | Break when D0 and D1 have the same value |
| `D0` | Break when D0 is non-zero (bare expression) |

If a condition is empty or cannot be parsed, the breakpoint is unconditional (always triggers).

### Memory Watchpoints

A watchpoint pauses execution when a specific memory address is read or written.

- **Add Watchpoint**: Click the **Add Watchpoint** button to open the dialog
  - **Address**: Memory address to watch (hex: `0x1000`, `$1000`, or plain `1000`)
  - **Size**: Byte (.B), Word (.W), or Long (.L)
  - **Type**: Write only, Read only, or Read/Write
  - **Condition** (optional): Same expression syntax as conditional breakpoints
- **Enable/Disable**: Toggle the checkbox
- **Delete**: Click the **Del** button

When a watchpoint triggers, the status bar shows the access details:
```
Write watchpoint at $00001000.W: $0000 -> $BEEF
```

> **Performance note**: Watchpoints add overhead to every memory access while active.
> Emulation speed will be reduced when watchpoints are enabled. Disable or remove
> watchpoints when they are no longer needed.

## Call Stack Window

Displays the current call stack. Open via **View → Call Stack Window**.
Call stack frame addresses are also shown in the disassembly view as green triangle
markers (**▸**).

The window shows:

- **Frame #0**: Current PC (highlighted in yellow)
- Each subsequent frame, most recent caller first
- Frames originating from a CPU exception or interrupt are tagged `(exception)` or
  `(interrupt)`

**Operations:**

- **Double-click** a frame to navigate the disassembly view to that address
- The window **auto-refreshes** on every Step, Stop, or breakpoint hit
- While running, the window shows "Running..."

### Inspection modes

The Call Stack window supports two inspection modes, switchable in
**Settings → Advanced → Call Stack → Mode**. The default is **Shadow Stack**.

#### Shadow Stack (default)

Tracks `BSR` / `JSR` / `RTS` / `RTE` / `RTD` / `RTR` execution at runtime in a
side-table maintained by the emulator, independently of any frame pointer
convention. This is the most accurate mode and works with virtually any code:

- **Strengths**: Works with `-fomit-frame-pointer`, hand-written assembly, and
  optimized code that does not use `LINK A6` / `UNLK A6`. CPU exceptions and
  interrupts are tracked, so you can see the path that led into a trap or ISR.
- **Cost**: Tracking is only active while the Call Stack window is open. There is
  a small overhead on every subroutine call/return when tracking is on; no overhead
  at all when the window is closed.
- **Caveats**: The shadow stack accumulates from the moment the window is opened.
  Frames belonging to subroutines that were already on the stack when you opened
  the window will not be visible until the program returns and calls them again.
  If this matters, open the Call Stack window before starting the run you want to
  analyze.

#### A6 Frame Pointer Chain

Walks the A6 frame pointer chain established by `LINK A6` / `UNLK A6`
(`[A6]` = saved A6, `[A6+4]` = return address), then performs a heuristic scan of
the top 4 KB of the supervisor/user stack to surface return-address-shaped
longwords that the chain may have missed. This is the legacy mode and is provided
mainly for bare-metal programs that do not use an OS:

- **When to use it**: Hand-written or hand-compiled programs that follow the
  classic A6 calling convention (e.g. small ROM monitors, bootloaders, freestanding
  programs built without `-fomit-frame-pointer`).
- **Strengths**: No runtime overhead. Yields a meaningful stack the moment the
  window is opened, with no need to wait for tracking to accumulate.
- **Limitations**:
  - **`-fomit-frame-pointer` code** (GCC default at `-O1` and above): Most
    optimized code does not maintain A6 as a frame pointer, so the chain is empty
    or truncated.
  - **Idle loops and interrupt handlers**: Stopping inside the kernel idle loop
    or an ISR usually yields only frame #0, because A6 is not a valid chain there.
  - **Heuristic false positives**: The 4 KB stack scan cannot tell a real return
    address from a data value that happens to fall in the code range. Heuristic
    entries are marked `?` and may be noisy. Double-click to verify in the
    disassembly view.
  - **No symbol resolution**: Addresses are shown as raw hex.

### Choosing a mode

| Situation | Recommended mode |
|-----------|------------------|
| OS guests (NetBSD, Linux, 147Bug) | Shadow Stack |
| Compiled C/C++ user programs | Shadow Stack |
| Bare-metal hand-written assembly | Either, A6 Chain if you cannot reopen the window |
| Standalone programs built `-fno-omit-frame-pointer` | Either |
| Standalone programs built with optimization | Shadow Stack |

> **No symbol resolution**: In both modes, addresses are displayed as raw hex
> values. There is no ELF symbol table integration to show function names.

- **Shadow Stack**: Tracks `BSR` / `JSR` / `RTS` at runtime while the Call Stack
  window is open. Accurate for any code (including `-fomit-frame-pointer` and
  hand-written assembly), with a small runtime cost while the window is open.
- **A6 Frame Pointer Chain**: Walks the A6 chain set up by `LINK A6` / `UNLK A6`,
  plus a heuristic stack scan. No runtime cost. Recommended for bare-metal programs
  built without `-fomit-frame-pointer`. Will return only the current frame for
  optimized code or interrupt contexts.

See the [Call Stack Window](#call-stack-window) section for a detailed
comparison of the two modes.

#### Debug
