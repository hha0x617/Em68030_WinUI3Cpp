## Breakpoints & Watchpoints Window

Manages breakpoints and memory watchpoints for debugging. Open via **View → Breakpoints Window**.

### Breakpoints

A breakpoint pauses execution when the CPU reaches a specific address.

- **Setting a breakpoint**: Double-click an address in the disassembly view
- **Enable/Disable**: Toggle the checkbox next to each breakpoint
- **Delete**: Click the **Del** button on a specific breakpoint
- **Clear All**: Click the **Clear All** button to remove all breakpoints and watchpoints
- **Run to breakpoint**: Press F5; execution stops when a breakpoint address is reached
- **Jump to address**: Double-click a breakpoint in the list to navigate the disassembly view

### Conditional Breakpoints

A breakpoint can have an optional condition expression. Execution only pauses when
the condition evaluates to true.

To set or edit a condition:

1. Open the **Breakpoints Window** (View → Breakpoints Window)
2. Click the **Cond** button next to the target breakpoint
3. Enter a condition expression in the dialog (e.g., `D0==0x1234`)
4. Click **OK** to apply, or **Clear** to remove the condition

Breakpoints with conditions display the expression below the address as `if D0==0x1234`.

Conditions support:

| Element | Examples | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Data registers | `D0`, `D7` | 32-bit value of the data register |
| Address registers | `A0`, `A7`, `SP` | 32-bit value of the address register (`SP` = `A7`) |
| Special registers | `PC`, `SR` | Program counter or status register |
| Comparison | `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` | Unsigned 32-bit comparison |
| Bitwise AND | `SR&0x2000!=0` | Test specific bits: `(SR & 0x2000) != 0` |
| Memory read | `[0x1000].b`, `[A0].w`, `[$2000].l` | Read byte/word/long from address |
| Address arithmetic | `[A7+12].l`, `[A0+0xC].w`, `[A7-4].b` | `+` or `-` offset inside `[...]` |
| IN set | `D0 IN {1, 3, 7, 20}` | True if value matches any element in `{...}` |
| Logical OR | `expr1 \|\| expr2` | True if either expression is true |
| Logical AND | `expr1 && expr2` | True if both expressions are true |
| Grouping | `(expr1 \|\| expr2) && expr3` | `()` overrides default precedence |
| Number formats | `255`, `0xFF`, `$FF` | Decimal, C-style hex, or Motorola-style hex |

`&&` has higher precedence than `||`: `A || B && C` is evaluated as `A || (B && C)`.
Use `()` to override: `(A || B) && C`.

**Condition examples:**

| Condition | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `D0==0x1234` | Break when D0 equals 0x1234 |
| `A7<0x10000` | Break when stack pointer is below 64KB |
| `SR&0x2000!=0` | Break when in supervisor mode |
| `[0x1000].w==0xBEEF` | Break when word at address $1000 equals $BEEF |
| `[A7+12].l==0` | Break when longword at (A7+12) equals 0 (stack-relative) |
| `[A0+D1].w!=0` | Break when word at (A0+D1) is non-zero |
| `D0 IN {1, 3, 7, 20}` | Break when D0 is 1, 3, 7, or 20 |
| `[A7+12].l IN {1, 3}` | Break when longword at (A7+12) is 1 or 3 |
| `D0==1 \|\| D0==3` | Break when D0 is 1 or 3 |
| `D0>0 && D0<100` | Break when D0 is between 1 and 99 |
| `(D0==1 \|\| D0==3) && SR&0x2000!=0` | D0 is 1 or 3, AND in supervisor mode |
| `D0==D1` | Break when D0 and D1 have the same value |
| `D0` | Break when D0 is non-zero (bare expression) |

If a condition is empty or cannot be parsed, the breakpoint is unconditional (always triggers).

### Memory Watchpoints

A watchpoint pauses execution when a specific memory address is read or written.

- **Add Watchpoint**: Click the **Add Watchpoint** button to open the dialog
  - **Address**: Memory address to watch (hex: `0x1000`, `$1000`, or plain `1000`)
  - **Size**: Byte (.B), Word (.W), or Long (.L)
  - **Type**: Write only, Read only, or Read/Write
  - **Condition** (optional): Same expression syntax as conditional breakpoints
- **Enable/Disable**: Toggle the checkbox
- **Delete**: Click the **Del** button

When a watchpoint triggers, the status bar shows the access details:
```
Write watchpoint at $00001000.W: $0000 -> $BEEF
```

> **Performance note**: Watchpoints add overhead to every memory access while active.
> Emulation speed will be reduced when watchpoints are enabled. Disable or remove
> watchpoints when they are no longer needed.

## Call Stack Window

Displays the call stack by walking the A6 frame pointer chain. Open via **View → Call Stack Window**.

The window shows:

- **Frame #0**: Current PC and A6 value (highlighted)
- **Subsequent frames**: Return address and saved frame pointer, traced via the
  `LINK A6` / `UNLK A6` convention (`[A6]` = saved FP, `[A6+4]` = return address)
- **Heuristic frames** (gray, marked `(heuristic)`): The window always scans the top
  4KB of the stack for addresses that look like return addresses (even addresses within
  the code range). These are shown in addition to any A6 chain frames, with duplicates
  removed. Heuristic frames cover code compiled with `-fomit-frame-pointer`, hand-written
  assembly, interrupt handlers, and broken frame chains.

**Operations:**

- **Double-click** a frame to navigate the disassembly view to that address
- The window **auto-refreshes** on every Step, Stop, or breakpoint hit
- While running, the window shows "Running..."

> **Note**: The A6 chain requires that functions use `LINK A6` / `UNLK A6` instructions.
> Most kernel code and optimized user code omit frame pointers, so the heuristic scan
> provides the majority of the call stack in practice. Heuristic frames may include
> false positives (data values that happen to look like code addresses) — double-click
> to verify in the disassembly view.
